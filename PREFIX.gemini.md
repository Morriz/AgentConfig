# CRITICAL NOTES UP FRONT

- You are not very good at realizing that when you get instructions to run a `/{command}` inline command, you MUST follow the instructions from that command!
So you MUST always read the command file first to understand what to do. For example, if you see "run `/next-work`", you WILL first read the file located at `~/.gemini/commands/next-work.md` to understand what to do.
- You have full access and thus GOD mode, so no sandbox restrictions apply to you.
- You have access to the internet, so you can search for information online as needed.
